        name="Ceren Yarar-Fisher, PhD"
        title="Principal Investigator"

        bio={`Dr. Yarar-Fisher is an Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Research at the Ohio State
        University Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Director of Clinical Research
        at the Belford Center for Spinal Cord Injury. Her translational research program focuses on
        understanding the pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord injury in the acute and chronic
        stages with the purpose of developing novel dietary and rehabilitation strategies to improve
        neuro-recovery, metabolism, and bowel function. Thus, her laboratory is currently developing
        and testing therapeutic diets and electrical stimulation programs to evaluate new ways to
        prevent neuronal death, promote recovery and function in the acute stages and improve body
        composition, gut microbiome composition, and skeletal muscle and metabolic health in the
        chronic stages of SCI. She has received several NIH and NIDILRR funding to support her
        investigations in SCI. She was selected as one of the 10 Outstanding Young Persons of Turkey
        by Junior Chamber International for her work in Academic leadership and accomplishment. She
        served two years as Treasurer, Chair-Elect, and Chair in American Congress of Rehabilitation
        Medicine (ACRM) SCI-Special Interest Group, and is a member of ACRM, Academy of Spinal
        Cord Injury Professionals, American College of Sports Medicine and American Physiological
        Society.
        Dr. Yarar-Fisher’s goal in mentoring is to have trainees leave her laboratory with the training
        and integrity to become leaders in their chosen field. Her mentoring style is empowerment-
        oriented, culturally sensitive, and excellence-driven. Dr. Yarar-Fisher intentionally created a
        space within her laboratory that harnesses her team’s collective interests to build a strong team
        with a common goal of contributing discoveries in SCI research and medicine and improving the
        quality of life for those impacted by the injury while recognizing and celebrating her team’s
        diverse backgrounds and identities. She believes science works best to produce novel insights
        when influenced by diverse ideas from individuals working together. She has had the privilege
        of mentoring a wide variety of students and trainees, including 3 high school students, 6 medical
        students, 4 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residents, 12 physical therapy students, 2
        doctoral students, and 1 post-doctoral trainee. She has also mentored 4 international visiting
        doctoral students and 2 visiting faculty from Hacettepe University/Turkey via Erasmus
        International Credit Mobility Program. 
        Throughout her career, Dr. Yarar-Fisher has devoted time to support the critical peer-review
        process, serving as an editorial board member of a prestigious SCI journal, an active
        manuscript reviewer for several peer-reviewed journals, abstract reviewer for prestigious
        organizations including the ACRM, and ad-hoc reviewer for the various NIH, DOD, NIDILRR
        study sections.`}

        bio={`I am a 4th year post-doctoral scholar at Rehabilitation Medicine Laboratory. I am from China, and I earned my master's degree in Molecular Genetics from the 
      University of Cincinnati and my PhD degree in Nutrition Sciences from Purdue University. During my PhD training, I was involved with clinical trials investigating 
      several aspects of dietary components on metabolic health outcomes. I greatly appreciated the applicability of human clinical nutrition research. In the meanwhile, 
      I became interested in exploring the underlying mechanisms for the development of cardio-metabolic diseases. I joined Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab in 2017 to further expand
      my training in nutrition research and gain additional skillset in microbiome and metabolomics analyses. My current research projects include: 1) investigating the 
      effects of a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet on body composition, metabolic health, and gut microbiome in patients with long-standing spinal cord injury and 2) 
      understanding the relationship between gut microbiome and glucose control in individuals with SCI supported by the NIDILRR Mary Switzer Research fellowship and Craig 
      Nielsen Foundation postdoctoral fellowship. I love spending time with my family, cooking cuisines from across the world, and traveling.`}

        bio={`I received my Bachelor's degree from KSU in Saudi Arabia, and my Master of Science degree in the neuromuscular field from the University of Pittsburgh, 
        Pennsylvania in 2016. I have worked as a physical therapist with a focus on neurological rehabilitation and as a TA at Qassim University. Currently, I am a 
        doctoral student in the Rehabilitation Science Program at UAB, and I joined Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab in Fall 2019. My primary research interest is investigating 
        the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle activity and metabolic health after SCI. My future goal is to be an educator and researcher in 
        Neuromuscular Physical Therapy with a focus on Neurological Rehabilitation. In my spare time, I like spending time doing outdoor activities with my kids, 
        hanging out with my friends, cooking new recipes, and swimming.`}

        bio={`I completed my PhD in Health at the University of Bath, UK in 2022. Specifically, I studied the effect of high-intensity exercise on cardiometabolic 
        health in individuals with spinal cord injury. My current research interests focus on identifying exercise and nutritional interventions to improve health 
        outcomes for this population. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing tennis, countryside walks, and watching soccer.`}
